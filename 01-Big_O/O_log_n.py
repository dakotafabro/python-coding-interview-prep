# O(log n) is asking the question "How many times do I need to divide 
# a number in half in order to get down to one unit"
# Log sub 2 of 8 is 3 because if you divide 8 in half 3 times you can
# get to single unit

#O(nlog n) is used in some sorting algorithms and typically involves splitting strings
